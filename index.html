<h2><i> Exploring the Added Value of Citizen Science In Species Distribtuion Modeling</i></h2>

<p>The Seatizen Science Project is working on a data management plan to exemplify the usibility of citizen science data sets. We are working specifically with a marine mammel dataset 
<br>that has been collected by citizen scientists in the Santa Barbara Channel since the 1990s. Part of our analysis of this data is to explore how it can be used in conservation planning.
<br>
<br>To address this question, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were created with governmentally collected, the citizen science collected, and a combination of both data sets to 
<br>explore the added value of citizen science data in constructing SDMs. Our preliminary results have found that the combined model had higher predictability (AUC=.913), sensitivity,
<br>and specificity (Cohen's Kappa = .063) than governmental data alone (AUC=.903, Cohenâ€™s Kappa=0.046).Our working group will be publishing the full results of our conservation  <br>
plan using these models <a href="http://www.seatizenscience.org/">here</a> in the upcoming weeks.
